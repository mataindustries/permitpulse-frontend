    <h1>Los Angeles ADU Permit Help: Garage Conversions &amp; Backyard Homes</h1>
    <p>
      ADUs (accessory dwelling units) and garage conversions are one of the most popular
      projects in Los Angeles—but the permitting can feel overwhelming. Between state ADU
      laws, local zoning rules, and separate building, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing
      permits, many homeowners and contractors get stuck.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Handles ADU Permits in LA?</h2>
    <p>Your permit path depends on where the property sits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inside the City of LA:</strong> ADU permits go through LADBS. The city offers an
        <strong>ADU Standard Plan Program</strong> that can speed up approvals for certain designs.</li>
      <li><strong>Unincorporated LA County / some cities:</strong> ADU permits may go through LA County
        Planning &amp; Building &amp; Safety using EPIC-LA.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key ADU Permit Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Confirm zoning and setbacks (is an ADU allowed on your lot?).</li>
      <li>Decide on conversion vs detached vs attached unit.</li>
      <li>Prepare architectural plans and utility layouts.</li>
      <li>Submit for building, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permits.</li>
      <li>Respond to plan check comments and obtain approvals.</li>
      <li>Schedule and pass inspections up to final sign-off.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How PermitPulse Fits Into ADU Projects</h2>

      <li>Identifying homeowners and investors who are actively working on ADUs.</li>
      <li>Running EN/ES outreach so you can offer construction, roofing, solar, or upgrades.</li>
      <li>Letting 24/7 AI phone/chat handle FAQs (“Can I add a second ADU?” “What about parking?”).</li>
    </ul>

      If you build ADUs, garage conversions, or backyard homes in LA, we help you spend
      less time hunting for work and more time building.
