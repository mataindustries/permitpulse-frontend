    <h1>Retroactive Permits &amp; Unpermitted Work in Los Angeles</h1>
    <p>
      Unpermitted work is extremely common in Los Angeles—especially older additions,
      garage conversions, and interior remodels. When it’s time to sell or refinance, buyers
      and lenders often want the work legalized through <strong>retroactive permits</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a Retroactive Permit?</h2>
    <p>
      A retroactive permit is when you apply for a permit <em>after</em> work was already done.
      LADBS or LA County may require:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plans showing the existing conditions.</li>
      <li>Engineering if structural changes were made.</li>
      <li>Opening walls or ceilings for inspections.</li>
      <li>Corrections to bring the work up to current code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Types of Unpermitted Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Garage conversions and ADUs built without permits.</li>
      <li>Room additions or enclosed patios.</li>
      <li>Electrical panel upgrades and rewiring.</li>
      <li>Plumbing relocations and bathroom additions.</li>
      <li>Major interior remodels with no record of permits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Buyers &amp; Sellers</h2>
    <p>Unpermitted work can impact:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Appraisal value and financing.</li>
      <li>Liability if something fails or causes a fire.</li>
      <li>Future permit approvals for new work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In many cases, the safest path is to work with design professionals and contractors
      who understand LADBS or LA County’s process for legalizing existing work.
    </p>
