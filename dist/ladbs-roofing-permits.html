    <h1>LADBS Roofing Permits: Re-Roof &amp; New Roof in Los Angeles</h1>
    <p>
      In the City of Los Angeles, most re-roof and roof replacement projects require a building
      permit through <strong>LADBS</strong>. For many standard residential re-roofs, homeowners or
      contractors can use the <strong>Express Permit</strong> system to pull permits online for small
      projects such as reroofing with approved materials.
    </p>

    <h2>When Do You Need a Roofing Permit?</h2>
    <p>In general, you should expect to pull a permit if you are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing and replacing roofing materials (comp shingles, tile, TPO, etc.).</li>
      <li>Changing the roof structure or slope.</li>
      <li>Adding new roof penetrations for solar, vents, or skylights.</li>
      <li>Upgrading the roof as part of a larger addition or major remodel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      LADBS provides homeowner guides and an express online system for many small projects,
      but it’s still your responsibility to make sure the work is properly permitted and inspected.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical LADBS Roofing Permit Path</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Confirm whether your property is under <strong>LADBS</strong> or <strong>LA County / EPIC-LA</strong>.</li>
      <li>Gather basic info: address, roof area, materials, contractor license, etc.</li>
      <li>Apply online through LADBS (for qualifying express permits) or schedule plan review.</li>
      <li>Obtain the permit, post it on site, and follow required inspections.</li>
      <li>Pass final inspection and keep records for resale and insurance.</li>
    </ol>
