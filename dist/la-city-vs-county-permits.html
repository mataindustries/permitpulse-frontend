    <h1>LA City vs LA County: Who Should You Pull Permits With?</h1>
    <p>
      One of the most common questions we hear in Los Angeles is:
      <strong>“Do I pull this permit with LADBS or LA County?”</strong> Getting this wrong can
      cost weeks of delay.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Jurisdiction Check</h2>
    <p>Here’s the simple way to figure it out:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Look up the address on the City’s or County’s online tools.</li>
      <li>Use LA County’s <strong>EPIC-LA Permit Helper</strong> or Service Locator to see if the property
        falls under County Building &amp; Safety or a contract city.</li>
      <li>If the property is in the City of Los Angeles, building permits generally go through LADBS.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Typical Split Between LADBS &amp; LA County</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LADBS (City of LA):</strong> Central LA, large parts of the Valley, Hollywood, DTLA, many hillside areas.</li>
      <li><strong>LA County Building &amp; Safety:</strong> Unincorporated pockets, some SGV areas, and contract cities where the County handles plan review and inspections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Jurisdiction Matters</h2>
    <p>Each agency has its own:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Online portals and forms.</li>
      <li>Plan review timelines.</li>
      <li>Fee schedules and calculation tools.</li>
      <li>Inspection scheduling systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Apply to the wrong place and you may have to cancel and start over.
    </p>
