    <h1>Need Help With Building Permits in Los Angeles?</h1>
    <p>
      If you’re staring at LADBS or LA County permit pages wondering where to start,
      you’re not alone. Los Angeles splits building permits between
      <strong>LA City (LADBS)</strong> and <strong>LA County / EPIC-LA</strong>, and the rules
      change based on your address, project type, and valuation.
    </p>

    <h2>LA City vs LA County: Who Handles Your Permit?</h2>
    <p>
      Most properties inside the City of Los Angeles pull permits through the
      <strong>Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS)</strong>, which handles plan
      review, permits, inspections, and code enforcement. Homeowners can apply online for
      common projects such as re-roofs, panel upgrades, window replacements, and small
      interior remodels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your property is in an <strong>unincorporated area</strong> or certain contract cities,
      permits often go through <strong>LA County Public Works / Building &amp; Safety</strong> using the
      <strong>EPIC-LA Permit Helper</strong> to figure out which office is in charge.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>LADBS (City of LA):</strong> Roof, solar, ADU, additions, remodels inside city limits.</li>
      <li><strong>LA County / EPIC-LA:</strong> Many areas in the SGV, unincorporated pockets, and contract cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common LA Permit Projects We See Every Week</h2>
    <p>In Los Angeles, the same projects come up over and over:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-roofs and roof replacements</li>
      <li>Solar panel installs and service upgrades</li>
      <li>Garage conversions and ADUs</li>
      <li>Room additions and major remodels</li>
      <li>HVAC changeouts and electrical panel upgrades</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each one has its own permit path, requirements, and inspection sequence. For busy
      contractors, keeping up with every change inside LADBS or the County portal is
      a full-time job by itself.
    </p>
